                <p>I'm here to teach and learn the art of coding. My first effort is this bio.<br> 
                I'm coming in with a background in music, which is not traditionally associated with analytical work, but I believe there's a connection between art and coding that's overlooked. <br> 
                Both involve intentional design, structure, and harmony between elements. <br>
                Neither can be mastered without a respect for how delicately balanced this harmony is. <br> 
                In other words, an orderly website is quite like an elegant piece in binary form: the structure of both allows unique ideas to hang over a scaffold and be communicated sensibly to an audience.</p>
